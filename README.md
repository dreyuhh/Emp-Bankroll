# Emp-Bankroll

The goal for the challenge was to create prompts to add employees first name, last name and salary into a table. Then, to create a code to display a random employee along with the average salary entered by user.

Acceptance criteria for challenge:
GIVEN an employee payroll tracker
WHEN I click the "Add employee" button
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts asking for first name, last name, and salary
WHEN I finish adding an employee
THEN I am prompted to continue or cancel
WHEN I choose to continue
THEN I am prompted to add a new employee
WHEN I choose to cancel
THEN my employee data is displayed on the page sorted alphabetically by last name, and the console shows computed and aggregated data
